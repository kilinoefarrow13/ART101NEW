    <p> BIRDS!!!! So many of them! </p>

    <p> All the birds of a feather
Do what they love most of all
We are the best at rhythm and laughter
That's why we love carnival
Possibly we can sing too (la-ia, la-la ia)
Sun and beaches, they coo (la-la ia, la-la ia)
Dance to the music, passion and love (la-la ia, la-la ia)
Show us the best you can do (la-la ia, la-la ia)
Everyone here is on fire (la-ia, la-ia)
Get up and join in the fun (la-la ia, la-la ia)
Dance with a stranger, romance and danger
Magic could happen for real in Rio </p>
